Benthic sleds (also called sledges) and bottom trawls both use nets to collect organisms while they are towed across the seafloor. While trawls use free nets with doors or beams spread the net, sleds use frames and runners to protect and secure the net (Eleftheriou and Mcintyre 2005). Benthic sleds target sessile or sedentary macrofauna and megafauna with some designs able to be deployed over rugged terrain, while bottom trawls are typically more successful in collecting demersal or mobile fauna and are deployed over smooth but compact terrain or soft sediments. 

There is no one type of sled or trawl suitable for all habitats and depths, and selection of the most suitable gear type depends on scientific objectives, previous knowledge, targeted fauna, environment, depth, and vessel capabilities (Clark et al. 2016, Kaiser and Brenke 2016). Acquired data are often described as semi-quantitative (Table 2.1 in Schiaparelli et al. 2016a) due to inconsistencies in gear path, swept area, and movement (e.g. sled skipping along seafloor), as well as taxa targeted by the gear (e.g. avoidance by highly mobile megafauna, herding effect in some fish). Imagery of the seafloor helps enormously with sled choice and deployment techniques. Imagery and geospatial positioning can be obtained with available technology and can aid in the success of each deployment. In the absence of imagery, bathymetry can also provide a good indication of gear suitability. The use of multiple types of sleds and trawls may be most appropriate for surveys trying to quantify overall biodiversity in a given location (Williams and Bax 2001, Clark and Roberts 2008), while a single sled or trawl type may be more efficient for quantifying species in a particular location or habitat for monitoring purposes (Przeslawski et al. 2015). For these reasons, this manual does not mandate specific gear types, although sled and trawl types historically used in Australian waters are listed in Table 8.1 to help facilitate decisions regarding equipment for a given marine survey. Nevertheless, for monitoring purposes, it is preferable to maintain consistent gear in time and space, and we therefore recommend this where possible.

For further information on the advantages and disadvantages of sleds and trawls compared to other benthic sampling platforms, refer to _Comparative assessment of seafloor sampling platforms_ Przeslawski et al 2018).

**Table 8.1:** Types of benthic sleds and trawls deployed in Australian waters and their associated characteristics. See reviews on benthic sleds and trawls for information about gear deployed elsewhere in the world (Clark et al. 2016, Kaiser and Brenke 2016).
